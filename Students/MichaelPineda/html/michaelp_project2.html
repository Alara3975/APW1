    <h2> Project Description</h2>

   <div>
     <h3>1/23/22-1/28/22</h3>
     <p>started some of my new project, found out the file I am trying to extract data from is a zip file, so I unzipped it and found three more files to extract data from. Hopefully will figure out how by the end of next week.</p>
   </div>
    
   <div>
     <h3>1/23/22-1/28/22</h3>
     <p>One of the three files is a json file containing metadata. Out of the other two files, I've found out that at least some of the data seems to be utf-8 encoded, but I haven't found a way to reliably extract the data yet.</p>
