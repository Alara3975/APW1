    <h2> Project Description</h2>

   <div>
     <h3>1/23/22-1/28/22</h3>
     <p>started some of my new project, found out the file I am trying to extract data from is a zip file, so I unzipped it and found three more files to extract data from. Hopefully will figure out how by the end of next week.</p>
   </div>
    
   <div>
     <h3>1/31/22-2/4/22</h3>
     <p>One of the three files is a json file containing metadata. Out of the other two files, I've found out that at least some of the data seems to be utf-8 encoded, but I haven't found a way to reliably extract the data yet.</p>
   </div>

  <div>
     <h3>2/7/22-2/11/22</h3>
     <p>I may have figured out a way to semi-reliably extract player names and their clan/guild from the replay file. I've only tested it on three files, from two different
     client versions though, so I'm still not sure if it will work for other files.</p>
   </div>

   <div>
     <h3>2/14/22-2/18/22</h3>
     <p>Started trying to figure out the rest of the data in the file (player movement, chat messages, shots, etc). This may take some time to decipher.</p>
   </div>
  <div>
     <h3>2/21/22-2/25/22</h3>
     <p>Had trouble with some other things this week, so I was unable to get much done. Hopefully will be able to do more next week.</p>
   </div>
   <div>
     <h3>2/28/22-3/4/22</h3>
     <p>Struggled with trying to figure out reliable patterns for data extraction this week</p>
   </div>
    <div>
     <h3>3/7/22-3/11/22</h3>
     <p>Still stuck, I might leave the first part for now and try to continue deciphering play movements/positions.</p>
   </div>
    <div>
     <h3>3/7/22-3/11/22</h3>
     <p>Finally found a pattern that worked to get each player name, it's worked for about 20 distinct replay files so far, and I'm hoping it will work for all.</p>
