	<p> Journal Entry Test: Now that I have my buttons working (I did a test one for this journal entry) I can begin to transform my page. I want it to be more organized. So the main page will have a bunch of buttons for each update and each button will link to each journal entry. I only have one week left so I'm not sure how far I'll get but all of this information is good to know!<p>
