		<p> 2/2/22: I am trying to recreate the Bitlife Prison Escape Game. </p>
		<p> 2/11/22: I made it so that if you put the parameters in for the walls and the size of the prison, it creates the general layout for the prison (minus the exit). </p>
		<p> 2/16/22: I made it so that it can sense where walls are or the spaces around (it's the beginning steps of making the characters move in each direction and stuff.)</p>
		<p> 2/25/22: I made it so that the computer prison guard moves on it's own. It doesn't exactly move how it's supposed to so I have to fix that. </p>
		<p> 3/4/22: I fixed it so that the prison guard moves properly, added the exit, and game over function. Now all I need to do is finish up the final aesthetic touches (including putting actual avatars instead of circles), and testing other prison setups -- making sure everything works properly. </p>
		<p> 3/11/22: I have been super busy this last week of break with the practice ACTS, 3 assessments, a bunch of projects and my birthday, so as of now at least I haven't changed anything and I probably won't by Friday. This project though, should be done the next update or two.
		<p> 4/1/22: I made the code way more efficient and made it so that different layout puzzles work. I just need to make the game stop when you win or lose and replace the circles with character pictures (also I should add more layouts). So far it seems that the game works the way it's supposed to though. </p>
