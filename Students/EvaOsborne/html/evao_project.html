		<p> 2/2/22: I am trying to recreate the Bitlife Prison Escape Game. </p>
		<p> 2/11/22: I made it so that if you put the parameters in for the walls and the size of the prison, it creates the general layout for the prison (minus the exit). </p>
		<p> 2/16/22: I made it so that it can sense where walls are or the spaces around (it's the beginning steps of making the characters move in each direction and stuff.)</p>
		<p> 2/25/22: I made it so that the computer prison guard moves on it's own. It doesn't exactly move how it's supposed to so I have to fix that. </p>
		<p> 3/4/22: I fixed it so that the prison guard moves properly, added the exit, and game over function. Now all I need to do is finish up the final aesthetic touches (including putting actual avatars instead of circles), and testing other prison setups -- making sure everything works properly. </p>
