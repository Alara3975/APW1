		10/23/21: Today I started a project with Shadab
		<br> 
		The Project is a Deep Learning Based Game where an AI should teach itself to play brickbreaker
		<br>

		10/29/21: This Week I worked on creating the Basics of the BrickBreaker Game Itself
		<br> 
		I am making the Code which will allow me to make custom Levels through text files. Shadab and I have made good progress with these developments.

		11/04/21: This week Shadab and I continued our work on the project. I was able to get the program to read the LevelOne.txt file the correct way. I also learned how to <strong> bold <strong>

		11/12/21: This week I continued to work on my project and I also worked on learning how neural networks work for my teachback project. I will have working code which will demonstrate my knowledge of neural networks.

		12/3/21: This Week I continued my work on my project with shadab. We are still working on creating the game in an efficient manner before delving into the world of artificial intelligence.

		12/10/21: This week i worked with shadab on the basics of the game once again. We are getting much closer to a finished product.

		12/17/21: This week i worked with shadab finalizing the basics and creating a plan for the break. We are going to try and have most of the basics done by the end of the break.

		1/20/22: Over the break shadab and I worked in the break and were working on making a full working game. We were able to get the basics of the game working. We have also decided to pause work on this project in favor of other pursuits.

		2/4/22: During the break Shadab and I looked into potential project ideas which will likely include art mixed with AI.

		2/11/22: Over the past weeks I have been looking for a new project and am looking into image recognition and art applications along with shadab.

		2/18/22: At the moment I am starting work on two projects. For the first project I am working with Ben on a project which includes more engineering. The idea of the project is that It can determine if a person is focusing on a given task. (Details to come). The second project is with shadab and related to music. The project will likely take MIDI files and find peoples taste in music. Eventually the program could be expanded to create music people like rather than simpily finding it.

		2/25/22:At the moment I am working on a visualization for midi files. This program will both allow for somebody to see the notes a MIDI file is playing while allowing a person to change the key of specific Instruments.
