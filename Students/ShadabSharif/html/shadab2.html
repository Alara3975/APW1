<h1>Welcome to my second page!</h1>

<h2>10/14/2021 Thursday</h2>
<p>From the previous classes until today, I've been working on my main website. In order to do that, I rekindled some of my old javascript skills using p5.js and looked at some of my previous projects, and edited them to fit the website. I also had to relearn a bit of HTML. I went through some trouble pushing my file onto the website, but overall there were no major issues and it went as smooth as coding can go.  </p>
<p>From now on, I'll start working on my project. Right now, I don't have a clear idea on what I want to work on. I want to do something a little interesting like facial recongition or voice recongition and connect it to something tangible like voice activited lights or facial recongition notebook page turner. On the other hand, I might want to do a discord bot. I'm going to experiment and research certain ideas in order to see what will be the best fit for me. </p>
<h2>10/21/2021 Thursday</h2>
<p>This week, I changed my teach back topic to Thunkable, a website/app builder without HTML or css code. I learned about this around 2 years ago at a hackathon at Riverdale and I sort wanted to highlight the pros/cons of using a app/website builder like this aswell as the limits of it. Also, Nathan and I decided on our topic which would be making a computer teach itself on how to play brick breaker. Nathan started a github repository and I forked it so that we can upload all of the changes we make.</p>
<h2>10/28/2021</h2>
<p>This week, I changed my teachback topic again. This time, I changed it to github copilot because I saw one of my friends use it and I thought it was interesting. I recently got access to the same program and it has been very fun and pretty intuitive. I finally created the local files from the forked project of Nathan's project and I starting make changes from my side and made sure it worked. I went through the same process that I went through for APW1. I also updated my side of the github file so that my version was the same as the original one.</p>
<h2>11/4/2021</h2>
<p>TThis week, I developed a bit of my teach back topic through starting a slideshow and messing around a bit with Github Copilot so that I can learn about it a bit more. I started working a bit more on the AIBrickbreaker project by trying to figure out how to make the bricks for the game with specific properties, and I kinda have an idea on how to do it but I'm not completely sure how to go about it.</p>
<h2>11/12/2021</h2>
<p>This week, I worked on the ball function but I struggled a bit because I am getting back into python. I also started to understand how the game is suppoused to work by working with Nathan. Nathan sent me a video and started explaining it. He sent me a picture and I tried to visualize it through a notebook drawing. Overall, I didn't do to much on the project but I spent more time trying to understand what we were doing, so that it will help me code the project for the future. </p>
<h2>11/19/2021</h2>
<p>This week I watched many videos on how other people made A. I programmed games as well as Deep Learning A.I programmed games. It was interesting to look at how the computer sort of learns how to play and how it memorizes certain algorithms and patterns to help it play out. I also kept working on our ball class in our program and possibly thought about making our game in unity to try out a new program as well as to make it a bit easier on ourselves.</p>
<h2>12/2/2021</h2>
<p>This week, I started my teachback project and finished the presentation so I am prepared to present for next week. My presentation is on A.I coding and how A.I can code for you and I learned a bit more about GPT-3 when talking to Mr. Lindow and through a bit of research during class. I am still working on the ball class and spoke with Nathan about hoping to finish the ball class and slider class by the end of winter break with the hopes of it being fully functional.</p>
<h2>12/9/2021</h2>
<p>This week I presented my teach-back project of A. I Coding through Github Copilot and OPENAI Codex. I messed around with the two programs a bit more to see the limitations and functions of each of the programs to see how intuitive they are. From what I've seen, Github Copilot imports more and has better comments but has more errors. OpenAI Codex, on the other hand, is a bit more complicated but hardcodes most of the information which makes it difficult to work with because it is completely hit or miss of what you want it to code. I am still working on the ball class and I still have the hopes to finish the ball and slider class by the end of winter break.</p>
<h2>12/17/2021</h2>
<p>This week, I did some things in my ball and slider classes but I mostly wanted to do a bit of testing with github copilot to see how it would rewrite the code I already wrote. I am planning out what I should write for each of the classes and I have comments in the code to help me when I do start writing it I just need to get around to writing it.</p>
<h2>1/28/2021</h2>
<p>This week, I struggled to upload my original edited APW1 but I hope this time it worked. Unfortunately, I lost my original text that I wrote but it's ok. This week, I've been focusing on finding a new topic and I've been seeing a bunch of videos on A.I generated Art based on a key word. I'm still not sure what to do my new topic on because A.I generated Art might take too long and it might be a bit too difficult for what Nathan and I are able to acocomplish. I learned a lot from my previous AIBrickBreaker project. I was able to finish the BrickBreaker portion of the game, but I was not able to do the AI part because it was too complicated. I sort've understood it, but I was not able to replicate it. I've also seen many other people try to do the same thing Nathan and I tried to do, but they all did it slightly differently which was interesting. Overall, I learned a lot about A.I and it is as challennging as I thought it would be!</p>
