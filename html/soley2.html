		<h1>Ciao! and welcome to what will hopefully be a successful project page!
</h1>
<div class="text">Oct 1: 💚💚By the end of the year I want to have built my own website, to showcase my photography, from scratch. To do this, I will need to familiarise myself with HTML, CSS and renew my Java... skills? Confidence is most definitely key!!! Anyways, to do this I will use the Odin Project HTML CSS JS online course as a resource. Ideally, I would be able to complete this course and then make my website, but since I am not sure how long the ~course~ will take, I think it does not make sense to say finish course by X Yth, 2021/2022. Rather, I will work on the website in bits in pieces, while taking the course. If all works as planned, I will have a website that I can buy a domain for and use for, dare I say, the rest of my life?💚💚</p>

<div class="text">Oct 15: 💚💚October 15: This week I started the Odin Project and began selecting my photographs for my website (obviously not very code-related, but considering I am working on building a website for my photography, I thought it would be worth mentioning). At first, I was tempted to skip through their introductory pages, however, I ended up going through them thoroughly and reading all attached/linked material. It was both interesting and comforting that they began the course with lessons on how to ask questions and approach coding. They had suggestions for how to work (25 mins working, 5 min break) and what to do when you are feeling overwhelmed and confused. I got some good vibes from it! Haha. During their “knowledge checks,” I recorded and answered questions in a google document, to interact more with the lesson and not only read. I also joined their Discord community/ linked it to my GitHub, which seemed very cool and exciting -- wow, this is free!??! Lastly, the final step of this 6 part intro was “How Does the Web Work?”. It was pretty time-consuming, including watching videos, reading articles, and answering questions. Below is a screenshot of my progress from the Odin site.💚💚
