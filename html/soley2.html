		<h1>Ciao! and welcome to what will hopefully be a successful project page!
</h1>
<div class="text">Oct 1: ðŸ’šðŸ’šBy the end of the year I want to have built my own website, to showcase my photography, from scratch. To do this, I will need to familiarise myself with HTML, CSS and renew my Java... skills? Confidence is most definitely key!!! Anyways, to do this I will use the Odin Project HTML CSS JS online course as a resource. Ideally, I would be able to complete this course and then make my website, but since I am not sure how long the ~course~ will take, I think it does not make sense to say finish course by X Yth, 2021/2022. Rather, I will work on the website in bits in pieces, while taking the course. If all works as planned, I will have a website that I can buy a domain for and use for, dare I say, the rest of my life?ðŸ’šðŸ’š
