        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>I created Simon to be a home integrated digital assistant. It's based around a natural language user interface and
        designed to aid with the simplest tasks from telling the time to complex web browsing.</p>
        <br />
        <h2>Features:</h2>
        <h3><u>Interaction</u></h3>
        <h4>Speech-to-Text</h4>
        <p>The Program currently uses the standard "Speech recognition" library. The library defaults to waiting 3 seconds
        after the user stops talking before it begins to transcribe, but this seemed too long and left too much time between
        command and response; I changed this time to .5 seconds which means the user does need to be more assertive when they
        talk (and not hesitate as much as they could) but it does allow for a faster response time. I also included features to
        drown out any background noise as well as a sound threshold which means the user has to speak at a certain volume for
        the program to hear. I am currently using my Laptop microphone (which means I have to be close to the computer)
        but I plan to upgrade to a larger mic which will allow me to speak from greater distances.</p>
        <h4>Text-to-Speech</h4>
        <p>For now, the program uses an IBM Watson API to generate speech. Once the speech is generated it gets passed through
        to the computer's MP3 player and plays it automatically. It will suffice during the creation process,
        but it poses two issues: The speech is quite artificial sounding and there is definitely a more realistic sounding
        speech generator. It also takes a little too long to create the speech and theres a little too much waiting time
        for the speech to play.</p>
