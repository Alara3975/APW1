<h2>January 2021 - Color Palette Generator</h2>

<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vS9-hhYKG7dsyVnaAf-wYUvbeNfwu4KXJ2SkUyYNb-e2XhUxB5g6zQNQXQjCG6dCnqLxZg4SrVJyh5h/embed?start=false&loop=false&delayms=5000" frameborder="0" width="960" height="569" allowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

<p style="color:darkslateblue">My most recent project is a random color palette generator. I presented on it as well as the history of colors in the programming world. My presentation should be above this text. For the generator, I used JavaScript as well as HTML to make it. It creates a randomly generated, non-coordinated palette of 5 different colors. I unfortunately could not get the hex codes to show without breaking the generator. To expand off what I have done so far, I could find a way to get the colors of the palettes to actually aesthetically fit together.</p>

<h2>June 2020 - Translator</h2>

<p style="color:darkslateblue">My project was a English to Spanish/Spanish to English translator in Python. I worked on this project with Leila last year. We used dictionary APIs from Merriam Webster to create a translator that will take a word in one language and translate it to the other language. As an expanding point from that, we would have started to try and make our translator translate whole sentences or phrases.</p>
