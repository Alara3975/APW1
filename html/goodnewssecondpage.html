<h2>November 2020 - Color Palette Generator</h2>

<p style="color:darkslateblue">My most recent project is a random color palette generator. It is complicated to do using just html but I am making headway with being able to generate a color at a time.</p>

<h2>June 2020 - Translator</h2>

<p style="color:darkslateblue">My project was a English to Spanish/Spanish to English translator. I worked on this project with Leila last year. We used dictionary APIs from Merriam Webster to create a translator that will take a word in one language and translate it to the other language. As an expanding point from that, we would have started to try and make our translator translate whole sentences or phrases.</p>
