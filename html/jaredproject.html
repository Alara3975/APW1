<p><b>A) I changed the color of my web page from green to blue. </b></p>
      <p>B) First, I want to take a short course on html, css and javascript. Although I looked at the Odin Project, it seems a little long and extensive for my purposes. I am going to watch a tutorial on youtube for both html and css as well as javascript. After that I am going to make some more edits to my webpage because it is very basic and rudimentary right now because I don't know enough to change it. My first actual project will be coding a Tic Tac Toe game using python. </p>

          I have been going through an html course on youtube. I already feel that I have learned a lot and feel much more comfortable with the language. <a href="HtmlCrashCourse.html">Here is the html page that I have been using to follow along with the course. </a> After the HTML and CSS tutorials I will make a robust visual and functional update to my pages.
