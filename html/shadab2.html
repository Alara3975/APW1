<h1>Welcome to my second page!</h1>

<h2>10/14/2021 Thursday</h2>
<p>From the previous classes until today, I've been working on my main website. In order to do that, I rekindled some of my old javascript skills using p5.js and looked at some of my previous projects, and edited them to fit the website. I also had to relearn a bit of HTML. I went through some trouble pushing my file onto the website, but overall there were no major issues and it went as smooth as coding can go.  </p>
<p>From now on, I'll start working on my project. Right now, I don't have a clear idea on what I want to work on. I want to do something a little interesting like facial recongition or voice recongition and connect it to something tangible like voice activited lights or facial recongition notebook page turner. On the other hand, I might want to do a discord bot. I'm going to experiment and research certain ideas in order to see what will be the best fit for me. </p>
