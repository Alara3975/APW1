<h1>Welcome to my second page!</h1>

<h2>10/14/2021 Thursday</h2>
<p>From the previous classes until today, I've been working on my main website. In order to do that, I rekindled some of my old javascript skills using p5.js and looked at some of my previous projects, and edited them to fit the website. I also had to relearn a bit of HTML. I went through some trouble pushing my file onto the website, but overall there were no major issues and it went as smooth as coding can go.  </p>
<p>From now on, I'll start working on my project. Right now, I don't have a clear idea on what I want to work on. I want to do something a little interesting like facial recongition or voice recongition and connect it to something tangible like voice activited lights or facial recongition notebook page turner. On the other hand, I might want to do a discord bot. I'm going to experiment and research certain ideas in order to see what will be the best fit for me. </p>
<h2>10/21/2021 Thursday</h2>
<p>This week, I changed my teach back topic to Thunkable, a website/app builder without HTML or css code. I learned about this around 2 years ago at a hackathon at Riverdale and I sort wanted to highlight the pros/cons of using a app/website builder like this aswell as the limits of it. Also, Nathan and I decided on our topic which would be making a computer teach itself on how to play brick breaker. Nathan started a github repository and I forked it so that we can upload all of the changes we make.</p>
<h2>10/28/2021</h2>
<p>This week, I changed my teachback topic again. This time, I changed it to github copilot because I saw one of my friends use it and I thought it was interesting. I recently got access to the same program and it has been very fun and pretty intuitive. I finally created the local files from the forked project of Nathan's project and I starting make changes from my side and made sure it worked. I went through the same process that I went through for APW1. I also updated my side of the github file so that my version was the same as the original one.</p>
<h2>11/4/2021</h2>
<p>TThis week, I developed a bit of my teach back topic through starting a slideshow and messing around a bit with Github Copilot so that I can learn about it a bit more. I started working a bit more on the AIBrickbreaker project by trying to figure out how to make the bricks for the game with specific properties, and I kinda have an idea on how to do it but I'm not completely sure how to go about it.</p>
