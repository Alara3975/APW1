<h1>Welcome to my second page!</h1>

<h2>10/14/2021 Thursday</h2>
<p>From the previous classes until today, I've been working on my main website. In order to do that, I rekindled some of my old javascript skills using p5.js and looked at some of my previous projects, and edited them to fit the website. I also had to relearn a bit of HTML. I went through some trouble pushing my file onto the website, but overall there were no major issues and it went as smooth as coding can go.  </p>
<p>From now on, I'll start working on my project. Right now, I don't have a clear idea on what I want to work on. I want to do something a little interesting like facial recongition or voice recongition and connect it to something tangible like voice activited lights or facial recongition notebook page turner. On the other hand, I might want to do a discord bot. I'm going to experiment and research certain ideas in order to see what will be the best fit for me. </p>
<h2>10/21/2021 Thursday</h2>
<p>This week, I changed my teach back topic to Thunkable, a website/app builder without HTML or css code. I learned about this around 2 years ago at a hackathon at Riverdale and I sort wanted to highlight the pros/cons of using a app/website builder like this aswell as the limits of it. Also, Nathan and I decided on our topic which would be making a computer teach itself on how to play brick breaker. Nathan started a github repository and I forked it so that we can upload all of the changes we make.</p>
<h2>10/28/2021</h2>
<p>This week, I changed my teachback topic again. This time, I changed it to github copilot because I saw one of my friends use it and I thought it was interesting. I recently got access to the same program and it has been very fun and pretty intuitive. I finally created the local files from the forked project of Nathan's project and I starting make changes from my side and made sure it worked. I went through the same process that I went through for APW1. I also updated my side of the github file so that my version was the same as the original one.</p>
<h2>11/4/2021</h2>
<p>TThis week, I developed a bit of my teach back topic through starting a slideshow and messing around a bit with Github Copilot so that I can learn about it a bit more. I started working a bit more on the AIBrickbreaker project by trying to figure out how to make the bricks for the game with specific properties, and I kinda have an idea on how to do it but I'm not completely sure how to go about it.</p>
<h2>11/12/2021</h2>
<p>This week, I worked on the ball function but I struggled a bit because I am getting back into python. I also started to understand how the game is suppoused to work by working with Nathan. Nathan sent me a video and started explaining it. He sent me a picture and I tried to visualize it through a notebook drawing. Overall, I didn't do to much on the project but I spent more time trying to understand what we were doing, so that it will help me code the project for the future. </p>
<h2>11/19/2021</h2>
<p>This week I watched many videos on how other people made A. I programmed games as well as Deep Learning A.I programmed games. It was interesting to look at how the computer sort of learns how to play and how it memorizes certain algorithms and patterns to help it play out. I also kept working on our ball class in our program and possibly thought about making our game in unity to try out a new program as well as to make it a bit easier on ourselves.</p>
