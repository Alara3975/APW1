<p style="font-family: courier"> Ella and I ran into a seemingly never-ending list of errors while doing our project. Our concept was to create a Mod for Minecraft and we looked through various tutorials to do so. 

First we downloaded the Java Developer Kit (version 8), which lets us mod on Minecraft in Eclipse. Next, we had to download software to set up our text editor. We downloaded the Eclipse IDE. We had to first launch the Eclipse installer to then install Eclipse IDE for Java Developers, since Java is the language used in Minecraft. My computer crashed while running the Eclipse installer and attempting to download Eclipse IDE, for whatever reason, but I just tried downloading it again and it worked. Then we downloaded the 1.12.2 version of Minecraft Forge, which lets us mod Minecraft 1.12.2, and versions beyond it. The version of Forge we used was Mod Development Kit (MDK) for 1.12.2. We unzipped the folder and created a new copy of it, which would become our project folder. The next software we installed was Pinta, which is a program that lets us change the look of the Sword texture in Minecraft. My version of Pinta, despite following a tutorial we found online, ended up being completely in Spanish. After troubleshooting this for a while and trying to re-download it, I gave up and just navigated the app in Spanish. Next we launched Eclipse and imported our project folder. We ran into more issues on this step since some of the software was outdated and no longer supported on my computer. After importing my project folder, there were many errors that appeared on my Eclipse workspace that Mr. Lindow tried to help me work through by researching them. There were also files missing from my project folder, so I went back several steps and redownloaded the Minecraft Forge, but this proved unsuccessful, and there were still missing files. I ran into more issues at the beginning of this process than Ella did, so we worked primarily from her computer over FaceTime. While Ella was importing the forge practice folder into the eclipse workspace she received an error message that said: “could not run build action using Gradle distribution.” We looked up what this error meant and found that this was due to an error connecting to the Gradle build system. There was no clear answer on how to resolve this issue so after some trial and error we decided to try and find another tutorial. We looked through other websites and read through a booklet, but none of the tutorials were detailed enough or able to teach us how to create a mod. We decided to retry and continue with the original tutorial. We downloaded other Gradle files and updated the build ship application in eclipse from her compute, but it was unsuccessful. Ella tried downloading a different version of forge practice but somehow also lacked the files needed to continue with the tutorial. She later had the same error with the Gradle system pop up, yet she hadn’t changed anything. We discussed that, while frustrating, it would be a better use of our time to switch to another project where we could make more progress. We have decided to instead build an Arduino remote control car. To do so, we plan to each order our own separate parts and coordinate to build together over Facetime.


Update for 1/15:

 To build my Tumbller V1.1 remote control robot car I ordered a kit I found on Amazon. First I screwed two motor brackets into an aluminum alloy board using Pan head machine screws. Then I screwed the motors into the motor bracket using Countersunk Screws. I made sure that the motor shaft was pointed down for both motors. I then screwed Round head Philips screws into two couplings and fit them onto the motor shaft. I then slid the tires onto the couplings and screwed them in. Next I screwed Double-pass copper columns into a foothold with Pan head machine screws and attached it to the aluminum alloy board. Then I fit a 1XGY-521 module onto an expansion board. To put the expansion board on top of the base of the car I screwed in Double-pass copper columns onto the aluminum alloy board and slid the expansion board into the columns. I the fit an ultrasonic sensor into the expansion board. Next I screwed in Single-pass copper pillars with Pan head machine screws into the corners of the alloy board. After that I took K-type gear nuts and Pan head machine screws and attached a lithium battery box to a plastic fastener. I placed the fastener on top of the Single-pass copper pillars and looped the wires through a slot in the fastener. I layered the Top plate on top of the fastener using Double-pass copper cylinders and Pan head machine screws. Then I attached two separate 6P cables from the ports to their corresponding motors. 

Since my kit only arrived on Wednesday, I just finished building the car. For the next couple weeks I will work on learning how to control it and possibly program it.  </p>
