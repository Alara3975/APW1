12/11/20 Update -- Working on figureing out Arduino, learning how to code diffent colors, ordered LED stips 

<br> 

12/18/20 Update -- Have led lights now, continuing to learn how to code diffrent effects using github and other sorces to learn diffrent effects. Havent run any tests yet -- need to figure out conections to the power supply and arduino.

<br> 
1/8/20 Update -- Contiued to learn the arudiuno softwear, going to test conections soon. LED effects are intact and ready for testing once conections are made. 

<br> 
1/15/20 -- Not too much done, but tryed to add more effects to software, trile and error. 
<br>
Samester update -- 1/22/21
This semester I worked on programming LED light strips using an arduino and arduino software. I started with learning the ins and outs of how LED light stips work, and the best approach for how to program them. I settled on using an arduino uno, which is a microcontroller. Once I got the arduino I installed a library on the arduino software that helped me translate the hue values of light into a format capable of being coded on arduino. I then started sourcing code for different effects. 
<br>
After I tested some basic code for turning the lights into different solid colors, I decided it was time to buy the led light strips and the connections necessary to get them hooked up to the arduino. This was the hardest part. Figuring out the connections for the arduino was an extreme  challenge. I had to test two power supplies due to one being too weak. I had to wire the power supply, arduino, and light strips in a specific order to enable them to work correctly.  There were a few instances where I connected the strips incorrectly and the strip would only show red and blue, but no green. Once I got it connected correctly the strips illuminated. Once I had them connected I ran a few of my base programs which turned the lights different solid colors. 
<br>
I then jumped back into the coding, learning how to create different effects like a strobe pulsing effect. Once I achieved different effects, I wanted to learn how to make even crazier effects. I am currently working on a block effect that adds colors shooting each color down the strip until it's full of different colors. I have already ordered another arduino that connects to wifi, so I developed some type of program to control the light strip remotely.

2/5/21 Update: Trying to figure out the best aproach for connecting my lights to wifi in order to use diffrent effects from a controller. 

<br>
2/26/21 Going through how to connect several light strips together to create diffrent effects from the same Arduino
<br>
3/12/21 Update: Working on new effects while I try to figure out how I am going to link two strips to one arduino, or if I need another one in order to run two diffrent effects on each strip.
