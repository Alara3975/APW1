	<h1>Welcome to Max "The Webmaster" Bremner's page. The Webmaster is an amazing word.</h1>
	<p> So, about having an interesting website. I couldn't think about what I wanted to do. I had some very big ideas but the idea of writing them in HTML, a language I haven't yet learned, scared the bejeezus out of me.</p>
	<p>maybe I could do something cool with coloring</p>
	<button onclick="SayHello()">From, Max</button>
