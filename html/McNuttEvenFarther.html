  10/22/2021: I Was surprised to learn that Maya cost $1000, that is too much money. I have downloaded Blender instead. I took a course years ago on using Maya, but I remember nothing. I assume that they are similar but we'll see. There are a few tutorials that I'm going to check out.

  11/4/2021: This week I watched and read a few tutorials on how to use Blender. I managed to load different objects into it, rather than just the starting object. Still figuring out how I could edit objects.
