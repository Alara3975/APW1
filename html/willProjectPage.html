		For my contribution to the class website project, I created my own page where I did some expirementing with html. I learned some of the basics of html and how to complete the process of submitted my changes, and recieving other classmate's changes.

		For my project, I'd like to make a multiplayer game. I would first learn some basics of C# and how to use the software "Unity". I'd like to recreate / make something similar to a game called League of Legends. It is third person with the camera looking down upon your character. Here is some example gameplay footage: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4QG59y6FGE" target="_blank">League of Legends gameplay.</a> It's a 5 versus 5 fight where the goal is to destroy the enemy's base. There are turrets that block your path though. They will shoot you if you get too close. Small computer controlled characters called "minions" will walk towards the turrets and take the damage for you while you destroy it. The enemy will also have minions so you have to kill the enemy's and push before they do the same. You can choose a character to play as, each one having unique abilities. You gain gold by killing minions and other players, which you can use to buy items that will make you stronger.

		I think making a smaller version of this could be a fun challenge for me. I like 3D modeling as well as coding so this project could combine two things I enjoy which would motivate me to work on it more often. Some goals I have for this project would be to make at least 6 unique characters so that there is a small selection to choose from which might make it feel more complete. I'd also like to be able to send this to, and play it with some friends. My main goal by the end of this project is to be able to confidently code in C#.

		<b>Week 1:</b> <br> For the first week of working on my project, I installed and setup unity on my computer. I found a very long and in depth course that I can do to learn the ins and outs of unity along with a good amount of C#.
		<a href="https://learn.unity.com/course/create-with-code?uv=2020.3" target="_blank"> Here is a link to the course</a>. I have been watching the videos and I'm on unit 1.2 so far. I will continue to go through the course over the weekend.

	<p>
		<b>Week 2:</b> <br> This week I continued to follow the unity course and I've become decently familiar and comfortable with the user interface. Now that I'm familiar with the interface, I've begun the parts of the lesson with C# coding. This weekend I plan to set up a unity collaborate thing that will let me work on the same project on a different computer. Unity is quite slow and laggy on my macbook so I hope to start mainly working on it on my PC at home. I also have blender installed on my PC that I can use to do some basic modeling for my game later on.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>Week 3 | October 29:</b> <br> This week I continued to follow the unity course and have continued to become more familiar with C#. I also started to focus on working on my teachback project about multiplayer games and how they work. I have done some research and I've put some information in a google slideshow. Over the weekend I will continue to work on the slideshow and follow the course on Unity.
