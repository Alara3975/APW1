		10/23/21: Today I started a project with Shadab
		<br> 
		The Project is a Deep Learning Based Game where an AI should teach itself to play brickbreaker

		10/29/21: This Week I worked on creating the Basics of the BrickBreaker Game Itself
		<br> 
		I am making the Code which will allow me to make custom Levels through text files. Shadab and I have made good progress with these developments.
