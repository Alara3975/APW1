	Project Idea(s):<br>
	<ul>
		<li>My / new version or gamemode of Minesweeper</li>
		<li>Arcade hub with a bunch of small minigames</li>
		<li>Create a multiplayer game? 
			<ul>
				<li> Learn C#</li>
				<li> Create it in unity</li>
				<li>(This is probably my favorite idea / what I will go with)</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		If I were to go with the multiplayer game idea I would first learn some basics of C# and how to use the software "Unity". I'd like to recreate / make something similar to a game called League of Legends. It is third person with the camera looking down upon your character. Here is some example gameplay footage: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4QG59y6FGE" target="_blank">League of Legends gameplay.</a> It's a 5 versus 5 fight where the goal is to destroy the enemy's base. There are turrets that block your path though. They will shoot you if you get too close. Small computer controlled characters called "minions" will walk towards the turrets and take the damage for you while you destroy it. The enemy will also have minions so you have to kill the enemy's and push before they do the same. You can choose a character to play as, each one having unique abilities. You gain gold by killing minions and other players, which you can use to buy items that will make you stronger.

		I think making a smaller version of this could be a fun challenge for me. I like 3D modeling as well as coding so this project could combine two things I enjoy which would motivate me to work on it more often. Some goals I have for this project would be to make at least 6 unique characters so that there is a small selection to choose from which might make it feel more complete. I'd also like to be able to send this to, and play it with some friends. My main goal by the end of this project is to be able to confidently code in C#.

	<p>
		This is the first paragraph. It can be seperated with the p tag. Typing in a new p tag will add a break between this first paragraph and the second paragraph. I'm typing random nonsense to make this paragraph long enough to see the break between them.
	</p>
	<p>
		This is the second paragraph. Notice how there was a break before it? That's because I used the p tag to seperate them both. I have run out of things to say in this paragraph already...
