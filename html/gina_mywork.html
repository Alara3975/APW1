        February 5th, 2021 <br><br>
		    Currently, I am in the process of deciding my semester project. I still haven't found much inspiration for what I want to work on. While figuring that out, I have been working on my website. I have added a footer, navigation bar, and I am hoping to add a slide show of images at the top. Something that I find difficult is organizing my html code and each parts' css attributes. I began with a rough sketch of what I hoped to achieve, which it is often more difficult to bring to life once it comes to the coding.

      <p> <strong> Journal 2: Possible Project? <br>
        </strong> February 21st, 2021 <br><br>
        I talked to Dr. Henry about my ideas for a coding project and she happened to be giving a presentation to teachers on implementing programming into other classes. In her physics class, we often use code to model real life experiments, which has been especially useful during Covid. I think going virtual has pushes other classes to use more virtual and online resources. <br>

        Though I was considering finishing a game I started a very long time ago, lately I've been leaning towards more useful and practical projects. Dr. Henry suggested that I talk to Mr. Chang, who attended her presentation, about writing a progrom for our math department. After talking to him, I think that a Math related, virtual simulation program would be possible. And could be implemented into Trevor math classes.

        So far the website has been going well and I really enjoy learning more about html and css. I feel fairly comfortable with both, but I am stikk working on efficency. Something I want to learn more about is javascript. I really want to create a stronger website, so part of this semester will be spent taking Javascript classes on codeacademy. <br>

        I've tried to add the slideshow I was talking about earlier, but I think I need to learn more about javascript to better understand how to implement one. I really like using fitted columns and boxes to organize my webpage with css, but I have a hard time getting them to look exactly as I envisons. Especially with specfic locations that stray from pre-set qualities. I've added the css for my journal entries includeding the boxes, shadows, and the overall spacing. I also struggled with the navagation bar a bit because I wanted my name to also be apart of the navagation bar, but not with the same attributes as the actual page options.

        </strong> March 8th, 2021 <br><br>
        Next year I plan on starting a club called Project Outreach and I have been working on the webiste that will go along with the club. The website is meant to make community service options more avalible to young adults, who are oftentimes too young to qualify for certain jobs. I plan on adding a search engine, but so far a few organizations are listed.<br>

        Meanwhile, I have the outline of my slideshow code, I just need to add the images and adjust the location. The slide show is slightly hovering over the navagation bar, and I haven't been able to move it down. <br>

        I also decided to take a codecademy course (that I mentioned earlier) on Javascript. So far it is going well, but I  sometimes get the syntax and style of different languages confused. Especially if I haven't coded in that language for a while.  <br>

        I am kind of sad to leave APCS behind, so I am planning on restarting the course either this year or next year to take the AP test.

        This is the <a href="https://project-outreach.glitch.me/">Project Outreach Website</a> I have been working on for the past while, I am going to work on adding more service options and creating the search engine I mentioned earlier. <br>

        I still havent fixed the slideshow. I am not really sure why it's blocking the top. I might try to play around with the css styling, I don't think it has any yet. <br>

        I am continuing with the codecademy Javascript course.
