		<h1>Welcome to Archie's Project Page</h1>
		<h3>As a first-year student in advanced Programming I wasn't assigned any work on the main project's page. I learned some HTML from doing all of this</h3>
		<h3>The project Jacob and I will be working on is called Creatr:  Creatr will be an online platform for long-distance collaboration, with a built-in project management system and educational resources. You might be thinking about all the things that Creatr is similar to. Github? Topcoder? Maybe Instructables? The truth is, nobody has made anything quite like Creatr, a platform not just for sharing projects, but for making them. From its inception, each project on our site comes with achievable milestones, from which the project manager can measure the growth of the project.</h3>
