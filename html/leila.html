		<h1> HI, I'M LEILA
		</h1>
		<p>
			I am excited for the upcoming year. I hope to learn html using code academy and make an app. Last year for my final project, I made a dictionary. Originally, I wanted to make a program that allowed the user to communicate with the computer through a chat. The user would type in something, and the computer would respond. The goal of this was so that people would be able to practice learning a new language if they did not have someone at home speaking to them. This year I plan to take my work from last year and build on it. I want to accomplish my original goal and hope to make the project into an app.
