      <p> For my contribution to the class website project, I added an image that I found online of someone holding a book infront of mountains. What I learned from doing this was how to add an image that I found online to my website. I feel like this is a good foundation for what I want to do for my project. What I have in mind is to make some sort of interactive image where browsers can draw whatever they want on a canvass that I put on the website. I'm not entirely sure how I will do this but I feel like if I can add an image of a plain white screen and have some function where people can interact with it, I can do it. </p>
