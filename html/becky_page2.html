	A. For my contribution to the class website, I made my own page modeled on Golanka's original code. On the page, I included a header along with a list that includes a link to google and a button that makes text appear. Additionally, I added an image of an elephant. I made a button that allows you to change the image when you click it. When you click on the button, it changes the image from an elephant to a turtle, then to Mickey Mouse, then to a girafe, then back to the elephant and so on. I also played with the graphics of the website. When I started this project, I had never heard of Github or Sublime and by the end I learned how to add buttons, images, links, and more. I now understand the basics of how to use Github and Sublime and actually find it quite fun to code by own website. </p>
 <p>	B. For my nect project, I would like to expand my knowledge on Github, as well as Sublime. I would like to keep adding to my website, however make it much more intricate and with a more specific and clear purpose. I have not decided specifically what I want to do yet but something along those lines.  </p>
