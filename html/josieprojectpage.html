<p>This is my project page. I am going to study html and CSS coding by taking a course.
Since I am new this year I was not able to help set up the class website but I worked on making my page, so it could be on the class website. I learned how git hub works and how to connect my coding in sublime to my website. I will next be taking a html and CSS course to learn how to code in html and CSS. I will be taking the course from the Odin Project. My goal is have completed and understand the course by before Thanksgiving break. My overall goal will to be completing the Odin Project by the end of the semester. My teachback will be about the how HTML and CSS differ but at the same time how they work together. </p>

<p><b>Takeaways from: Introduction to Git and Git Basics</b></p>
<p>Introduction to Git (history of git, what it is, and what it is useful for): Git is basically a save button for files and directories. In short, it is a version control system. For example, if you save something in a text editor in a document, they are saved into a single file. There is only one automatic copy of the file unless you go personally to make copies. Save in github = recorded differences in files and folders AND keeps a historical record of each save. When connected to a network, you can push your project to github to share and collaborate with other developers (like what we do as a class to share our work). Git is an essential skill for modern web developers. Git is local and GitHub is remote wehere everything ends up. </p>
<p>Git Basics (10/28/21): I learned the common Git commands that are needed to manage projects and to upload finalized work onto Github. These commands are known as the <b>basic Git workflow </b>. The difference between the git_test ripositiory I made and the APW1 ripository is that the APW1 is connected to a 3rd party/shared and is set up to be a webpage to (which is exaclty what you are reading right now. In the first couple of steps of Git Basics I have set up a new respitory inside my GitHub and put that in a new directory called Repos. The name “origin” is both the default and the convention for the remote repository. </p>

<p><b>Takeaways from: HTML Foundations</b></p>
<p>Introduction to HTML and CSS (11/4/21): HTML and CSS are two langague that wok cohesivley to create pretty much everything you see when looking at something on the internet. HTML is raw data that makes up a webpage. CSS is the cosmetic design/style to those elements that make up the webpage. There both are not technically programming languages because their purpose is to present information not make information. Although, the formation of any website will need HTML, CSS, AND Javascript. Javsscript increases interactivity. </p>
