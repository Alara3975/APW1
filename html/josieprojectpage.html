<p>This is my project page. I am going to study html and CSS coding by taking a course.
Since I am new this year I was not able to help set up the class website but I worked on making my page, so it could be on the class website. I learned how git hub works and how to connect my coding in sublime to my website. I will next be taking a html and CSS course to learn how to code in html and CSS. I will be taking the course from the Odin Project. My goal is have completed and understand the course by before Thanksgiving break. My overall goal will to be completing the Odin Project by the end of the semester. My teachback will be about the how HTML and CSS differ but at the same time how they work together. </p>

<p><b>Takeaways from: Git Basics (Indroduction to Git)</b></p>
<p>Introduction to Git (history of git, what it is, and what it is useful for): Git is basically a save button for files and directories. In short, it is a version control system. For example, if you save something in a text editor in a document, they are saved into a single file. There is only one automatic copy of the file unless you go personally to make copies. Save in github = recorded differences in files and folders AND keeps a historical record of each save. When connected to a network, you can push your project to github to share and collaborate with other developers (like what we do as a class to share our work). Git is an essential skill for modern web developers. (not done yet)</p>
