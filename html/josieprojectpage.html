This is my project page. I am going to study html and CSS coding by taking a course.
Since I am new this year I was not able to help set up the class website but I worked on making my page, so it could be on the class website. I learned how git hub works and how to connect my coding in sublime to my website. I will next be taking a html and CSS course to learn how to code in html and CSS. I will be taking the course from the Odin Project. My goal is have completed and understand the course by before Thanksgiving break. My overall goal will to be completing the Odin Project by the end of the semester. My teachback will be about the how HTML and CSS differ but at the same time how they work together.

I will take the lessons on Git Basics which consist of 2 lessons. 
Deadline - 10/21/21

Deadline - 11/11/21
