This is my project page. I am going to study html coding by taking a course.
Since I am new this year I was not able to help set up the class website but I worked on making my page, so it could be on the class website. I learned how git hub works and how to connect my coding in sublime to my website. I will next be taking a html course to learn how to code in html. I will be taking th course from the Odin Project. My goal is have completed and understanmdn the course by before Thanksgiving break.
