<h1>Tips and Hints</h1>

</body>

For my project, I am planning on doing The Odin Project. The Odin project will allow me to learn about all the basics of web programming and about the computer and how it actually works. All of these lessons will help me grasp useful information and all of the work and steps that go into creating a website and serving content on the web. I think that this course will be great for me and I am very excited to learn a lot more about how everything works "behind the screen". When I complete this course I should have a good understanding of the fundamentals of web programming and I can't wait to be able to understand. 

<p><b> First: <b><p/>

October 21- 
This week I started the lessons and read about everything I should expect for this course. I learned all about front end, back end and full stack devolopers. Front end devolopers are the covers of the operation and what is on the browser. The Back end programers have what lives on the server. It can be very complicated especially when so many people are on the same browser at one time. Back end programers use programs like python, java, and ruby. Lastly, Full stack devolpers can do both what front end and back end programs do. During this project I will learn to be a full stack developer. I am excited that I will be learning all about full stack devolopers throughout this course and I think that this week was very sucsessful learning wise.
