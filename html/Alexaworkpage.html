<h1>Tips and Hints</h1>

</body>

For my project, I am planning on doing The Odin Project. The Odin project will allow me to learn about all the basics of web programming and about the computer and how it actually works. All of these lessons will help me grasp useful information and all of the work and steps that go into creating a website and serving content on the web. I think that this course will be great for me and I am very excited to learn a lot more about how everything works "behind the screen". When I complete this course I should have a good understanding of the fundamentals of web programming and I can't wait to be able to understand.
