<h1>Tips and Hints</h1>

</body>

For my project, I am planning on doing The Odin Project. The Odin project will allow me to learn about all the basics of web programming and about the computer and how it actually works. All of these lessons will help me grasp useful information and all of the work and steps that go into creating a website and serving content on the web. I think that this course will be great for me and I am very excited to learn a lot more about how everything works "behind the screen". When I complete this course I should have a good understanding of the fundamentals of web programming and I can't wait to be able to understand. 

<p><b> First: </b></p>

<p>October 21- 
This week I started the lessons and read about everything I should expect for this course. I learned all about front end, back end and full stack devolopers. Front end devolopers are the covers of the operation and what is on the browser. The Back end programers have what lives on the server. It can be very complicated especially when so many people are on the same browser at one time. Back end programers use programs like python, java, and ruby. Lastly, Full stack devolpers can do both what front end and back end programs do. During this project I will learn to be a full stack developer. I am excited that I will be learning all about full stack devolopers throughout this course and I think that this week was very sucsessful learning wise. </p>

<p>October 28-
This week I learned about motivation and mindset. I decided that I am going to have a positive mindset about this project, although there are going to be chanllenges, I will push through with a good attitude. I was very intrested to learn about all the different types of mindsets. There is the fixed mindset, which is when you mess up, you think that you will never sucsessful. You may think they arent smart enough to complete any of these tasks, and just give up. This is not the best mindset to have especially when you are still growing and learning everyday. Then there is the growth mindset. This is when you believe that with hard work, and persistence you can do whatever you set your mind to. This is an amazing mindset to have especially when you are young and still have lots of time to learn and grow. I also learned about the learning process. The learning process consists of 2 different modes. Focus mode and difuse mode. When in focus mode you are staying atentive, on task, and activily reading. When you are in difuse mode, you are usally doing something else whilst doing the task, not fully atentive, and distracted by things such as chores, plans etc. I learned about the pitfalls I should avoid,such as procrastination, not taking breaks, and distractions both physical and digital. I enjoyed this weeks lesson because I learned alot about the things I need to know for this project and Im excited to start.</p>

This week for my project I learned all about the pitfalls to avoid how to stay on task. I learned all about community and why it is important. Asking for help is a crucial aspect of being sucsessful with this project and learned how to format my questions and the chat features. I completed the assingment which was to join the discord and allow for others to see my progress and what I am doing. 

<p>Novemeber 18th- This week I listened to Nathan, and Ginas teachback. During Nathans teachback I learned all about how neural networks work. Example of neural network, text recognition. This was a very intresting teachback and I learned a lot about neural networks. In Ginas presentation I learned about computer science in the medical field. 

<p>December 2nd- This week we listened to Annas teachback and learned about deepfakes. I also worked on my project. I learned about a simple network and how it works. I also worked on my teachback, which I am talking about fron end, back end, and full stack devolopers. I talked anout how the network works and the internet and extranets.

<p>Decemeber 9th- I presented my teachback and I listened to Shadabs teachback. I learned all about A. I coding during Shadabs presention
