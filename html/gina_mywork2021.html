      <p> <strong> Journal 1: Project Planning </strong><br>

        October 14th, 2021 <br><br>
        I added the students' webpages to the class website navagation bar. I am also starting a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wFsB1sq4Pp8CoFx1cvgY3F0lxfPP3eNcDFi2j7_0dV0/edit?usp=sharing">document</a> with some naming and organizational conventions for the future so we can create a system for the APW1 files. Right now the folder is a bit chaotic, and I think with more organization it will be easier to update and it will also work towards preventing merge errors as people simultaneously work on their personal pages. I also started a slack workspace for APW1, which can help us collaborate on different projects. Different hashtags represent different channels and people can be added to those specific or genral channels depending on what they are working on. <br><br>

        In college I am interested in going on a pre-med track, but I would still want computer science and programming to be a part of that, so I've decided to do my teachback on how CS can be used in the medical field. So many different fields have connections to programming now that techonolgy has become an essential tool in life, so I'd be interested to see the possible applictions. <br><br>

        I would like to work on the shared website and a personal project this semester. I'll add the repository once I decide on a project. I am thinking of continuing my cyrptocurrency project from last year, and extending the trading bot to have more complex ways of assessing buying and selling times. Last year, it used the RSI, but this isn't a very good tool for real life purposes, especially on its own.

        October 21th, 2021 <br><br>
        Last year the buying and selling reccommendations were based on past changes with low and high candlesticks, but I think it would be more interesting to work on a method of predicting the future stock changes by finding patterns from the past. And then those future predictions will deterimen when the bot automatically buys and sells. It would also be helpful to have it calculate some form of accuracy, but I am not sure how that would be determined. <br><br>


        The first forumla I found is <a href="https://getmoneyrich.com/how-to-predict-if-a-stock-will-go-up-or-down/">P/E x EPS = Future Price</a><br>
        P/E = Price/Earnings = Price to earning ratio<br>
        EPS = (Net Income - Dividend Payments)/ Weighted Average Outstanding Shares = Earnings per share <br><br>

        One thing I am strugging with is the dropdown content on my navagation bar. I can't get it in the right location. It's in the center but I want it to be right of the Home button. I tried using different floats, but it doesn't change anything except the dropdown content's position. The differences between and functions of float, display, and position are a bit confusing to me.

        October 28th, 2021 <br><br>
        
        As can be seen by the current state of the navagation bar, I still haven't managed to move "My Work" to the right of "Home." I tried going through the details of the css (both the elements that I added and default attributes), but still couldn't figure out why, no matter what I change, it stays in that location (or some other problems occur). It seems so simple!  <br><br>

        Project wise, I am still researching stocks and prediction methods. Also, now that Mr. Lindow has shared the APW1 students' emails, I'll send out a slack invite.

      <p> <strong> Journal 4: Teachback </strong><br>

        November 4th, 2021 <br><br>
        
        Next class, after conference day and two weeks from now, I will be giving my teachback on the ways CS can be applied into the medical field. I have just applied to my ED EA colleges, and I am applying in for chemistry (most likely organic) and hope to double major or minor in computer science. Though I am not sure about what I want to do in the future, pre-med is definetly something I am considering. I know I don't want to major in biology, but chemistry would still align with some of my med school requirements. For some of my essays I wrote about how I want to approach the medical field from a tecnological and chemical perspective, a combination of my interests. <br><br>

        So now my focus has been making my presentation.

       I haven't had much time to work on my programming projects. But I have been continuing to work on my techback, including research and organizing that information.

      Since my teachback was pushed back I spent this week finishing my presentation script and adding key sentences or words to my slides. I also added images.

      <p> <strong> Journal 7: Backend and Front End</strong><br>

      December 3rd, 2021 <br><br>
      
      For my project, I am upgrading and extending my project from last year. Earlier, I wrote two seperate programs, one to do the actual buying and selling and recommending, and another with the visual interface. I didn't have the chance to link the two, but that was definetly a goal of mine from last year. So now I am working on figuring out how to sync the two and connect the interactive features of the webapp to the functions in the code. The original code would print out its actions, and text the user, which I want to keep in place. It would work automatically in the background. I hope to keep the automatic feature, while also implementing a manual option when I connect the web app.
