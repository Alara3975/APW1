		<p style="font-size:20px;">I updated the roster on the website for this section. I have the changes saved locally because I am waiting to upload them so that we can coordinate across all 3 sections. This year, I plan to take a course in either C# or Javascript, or create plugins for games.</p>
		<div style="font-size:20px;">
			<p><b>10/8:</b> Coming up with ideas on what types of plugins to make. I will probably make some sort of a chat filter.</p>
			<p><b>10/15:</b> Figuring out what application I will use to create these plugins. I wasn't able to get too much done this week as I had a lot of work and college essays to write. I hope to get more done next week.</p>
