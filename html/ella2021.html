<h1> Group webpage work:</h1>
<P> For my eddition to the class webpage I worked on the css styling of the page and added some comments to the style.css file to help others understand the code in the future </P>

<h2> My 2021 project: </h2>
<p> For my project this year I am starting by taking a Html and css course in order to really understand how to make a website. As I progress through the course I will be updating this webpage to show new things that I have learned. I will also be sharing what I have learned with the girls who code club and teach them about html so we can then collectively make a club website.</p>
<p> I have made a lot more progress in the html course and have started creating a lesson plan for girls who code</p>
