	Hi Everyone. My page is going to be linked to a new page for a project Andres and I are working on. 
	Quick Update!: Since spring break and quarantine I have been taking an html course from codecademy that I just finished. I was unable to finish my project with Andres because our materials were left at school. Thank you everyone for a great year! Have a great summer and see you next year!
