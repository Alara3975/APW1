For a little while I was slowly adding to a game that I had made last year, but I decided I wanted to try something else.  

<p> For my project that I am going to try now I am going to create a madlibs story that asks the user to fill in missing words. Without knowing what the story is about the user will input nouns, verbs, names, places, etc, and those words will be inserted in the story in the correct place. To do this I will have to figure out how to get user input in a text box and how to insert words into the middle of other text. 

<p>12/20/20: I have a few lines that will be used as the story, as well as where the user can type there words. The users words are currently added to the end of the story. I now need to find a way to put the words that the user types into the currect place in the story.

<p>1/10/21: I currently have a short but working madlibs game, where the user inserts 3 words of a given part of speech and it correctly inputs them into the story. It then reveals the final story when the "madlibify" button is pressed. I am probobly going to make this story longer.

<p>1/17/21: Added one more place for the user to input a word.

<p>1/20/21: Added two more places for the user to input words.
