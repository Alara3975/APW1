<p>For my next project I am going to create a madlibs story that asks the user to fill in missing words. Without knowing what the story is about the user will input nouns, verbs, names, places, etc, and those words will be inserted in the story in the correct place. To do this I will have to figure out how to get user input in a text box and how to insert words into the middle of other text. </p>
