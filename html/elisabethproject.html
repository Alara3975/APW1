<p> My project is to do the odin project and learn to build a website. After/while completing it, I will create a website about skiing. </p>

<p> Today I read the introduction into the odin project and created an account </p>

<p>On October 28, I completed the first assignment. This taught me the basics of what internet is. I watched videos, read articles, and answered questions.
