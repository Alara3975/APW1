		<p><p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>My Project:</strong></span> <span style="font-size: 20px;">At the end of last year Asher and I worked on our final project together. We did not get to finish it, so we hope to finish it this year. Our plan for last year was to be able to have our computers recognize our faces. With that information we then wanted the computer to to shut down when any other face, besides our own, came into the frame. By the end of the year we were able to get my computer to identify my face. Asher ran into a couple problems because we are working off of different computers so he did not get his to work. This year we hope to complete our initial idea and get Asher&apos;s computer to work the same as mine.</span></p>

		<p><b>10/22 Update:</b> In order to make the face recognition a little more secure I thought of finding ways to recognize my eyes and smile so it's not as ambiguous. I noticed when I was showing Mr.Lindow my project in class that it recognized my face even with the fask, so that makes the program way less secure. I found new code to attempt this but I don't have it functioning completely. Also instead of working to completely shut off the computer when it sees another face it might be smarter and more simple to just have a picture cover up the screen. We will make it so that no one is able to get rid of the picture (more of else the screen will be frozen) unless they press specific keys which only I will know. It seems way more unlikely that we will be able to completely override the software of the computer to simply shut it off. This new idea might be a little smarter. </p>

		<p><b> 10/28 Update:</b> This week we had a bit of a slow start. Asher was not available much this week to work because of college applications and our main focus was getting his computer to work, running our original program. I was able to get a black image show up which we are going to have display when an unknown face enters the screen. For now the black image shows up when I press the key 'a' because before it was stuck in a loop, so now that is fixed. Unfortunately there is a border on the image and a border on Python images in general. I tried to find a way to get rid of it and I found some type of code that I have working but it didn't work to get rid of the border. I will continue to try to remove the border but I also might just try to expand the image a lot so that the Python border doesn't show up at all. Not sure if that will work but I'll keep you updated!!
