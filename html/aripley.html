We did not get to finish it, so we hope to finish it this year. Our plan for last year was to be able to have our computers recognize our faces. With that information we then wanted the computer to to shut down when any other face, besides our own, came into the frame. By the end of the year we were able to get my computer to identify my face. Asher ran into a couple problems because we are working off of different computers so he did not get his to work. This year we hope to complete our initial idea and get Asher&apos;s computer to work the same as mine.</span></p>
