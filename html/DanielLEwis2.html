  <h1> My name is Daniel Lewis and this is what I'm going to do for my project</h1>





<p style="background-blend-mode: color-burn;" style="text-align:center;">
For my independent project, I am going to work on Brilliant courses, and hopefully give a teachback on what I've learned. First I am going to start with Logic courses 1, 2 and then Joy of Problem solving. I think that these will be useful for coding, helping me look at programming more logically, and giving myself the courage to problem solve when hit with a road block. I will take that knowledge into actual programming courses such as, Computer Science Fundamentals, Algorithm Fundamentals and Programming with Python. If complete all of these and have time for a second project, I would like to learn website design. Will add more details when I come closer to it.
